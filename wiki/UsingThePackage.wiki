#summary Working with the pPOD-Mesquite package

= Basics =

===Downloading from the pPOD Server===

After firing up Mesquite, here's how to download from the pPOD server:

  *  *_File>Open Other>Download from pPOD Database_* will query pPOD server for the projects it has stored and return a list for you to choose from. 
  *  *_File>Open Other>HQL Query against pPOD database_* will bring up a dialog to query agains the database using given certain criteria like taxon, character, and character state names.

===Uploading to the pPOD server===

Open up a Nexus file (RNA matrices are not yet supported.) There is a _pPOD_ item in the project window which if clicked will reveal
    * *_Upload changes to Server w/ Molecular Matrices as pPOD Matrices_* this will upload your project storing the data in the pPOD server. 


= Generating HQL Queries =

Let's start with a simple one: give us all Taxa Block that contain Taxa sus and equus (queries are not case sensitive):

After we hit "Count Matches" it will show us the number of matching items. Hitting "OK" will return the results. Currently, if the total number of items is more than 15, you'll get an error back. This is because it's unwieldy to have more than 15 items to view in the Mesquite window.

We can add in characters and character states we want to filter by, also let's throw some wildcard characters ('%') in the taxa names and character/states to show how those can be used:

This says, give me all character matrices that have taxa named `equ%` and `s%s`, and where the `equ%` taxon has a character called `anterior%`, and the `s%s` taxon has a character named `tensor%` with state `circular%pit%`, and the matrix has a state named `anterior`.

Note that at present only character matrices which match the criteria will be returned. Which is different from, say, DNA matrices, where we return any DNA matrices that are attached (via taxa block) to a matching character matrix. That is, we don't return character matrices which are attached to matching character matrices, only matching character matrices. Maybe that's too confusing to mention.
