#summary Explanations of non-obvious stuff.

1) Why did you map cells and rows the way you did? 

We tried (from http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/annotations/reference/en/html/entity.html#entity-hibspec-collection-enhance):

{{{
@Entity
public class Parent {
    @OneToMany
    @org.hibernate.annotations.IndexColumn(name="order")
    @JoinColumn(name="parent_id", nullable=false)
    private List<Child> children;
    ...
}

@Entity
public class Child {
    ...
    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name="parent_id", insertable=false, updatable=false, nullable=false)
    private Parent parent;
    ...
}
}}}

but it was too slow on at least saves. This was because it performed many extra updates for unknown reasons./
