#summary How a visitor travels through the entity object network

= Introduction =

Some information is propagated through the pPOD object tree. The hierarchy is as follows:

|| ||`Study`||||
|| ||`OTUSet`||||
||`OTU`||`CharacterStateMatrix`||`TreeSet`||


= pPOD Version Number =

These were created to enable quick notification to a client of changes in a pPOD database. 

  * `CharacterState` -> `Character`
  * `Character` -> `CharacterStateMatrix`

  * `CharacterStateCell` -> `CharacterStateRow`, `CharacterStateMatrix.getColumnPPodVersionInfos()`
  * `CharacterStateRow`, `CharacterStateMatrix.getColumnPPodVersionInfos()` -> `CharacterStateMatrix`

  * `CharacterStateMatrix` -> `OTUSet`

  * `OTU` -> `OTUSet`
 
  * `Tree` -> `TreeSet`
  * `TreeSet` -> `OTUSet`

  * `OTUSet` -> `Study`
 
 

= pPOD Visitor =

The `accept` method on the pPOD entities follows the pattern of the pPOD version number propogation, but travels in the opposite direction: it goes from `Study` downward.

  * `Study` ->`OTUSet`

  * `OTUSet` -> `OTU`, `CharacterStateMatrix`, `TreeSet`

  * `CharacterStateMatrix` -> `CharacterStateRow`
  * `CharacterStateRow` -> `CharacterStateCell`

  * `TreeSet` -> nowhere yet
