#summary How a visitor travels through the entity object network

= Introduction =

The `accept` method on the pPOD entities follows the pattern of the pPOD version number propogation, but travels in the opposite direction: it goes from `Study` downward.

= pPOD Version Number =

These were created to enable quick notification to a client of changes in a pPOD database. 

 * `CharacterState` -> `Character`
 * `Character` -> `CharacterStateMatrix`

 * `CharacterStateCell` -> `CharacterStateRow`, `CharacterStateMatrix.getColumnPPodVersionInfos()`
 * `CharacterStateRow`, `CharacterStateMatrix.getColumnPPodVersionInfos()` -> `CharacterStateMatrix`
 * `CharacterStateMatrix` -> `OTUSet`

 * `OTU` -> `OTUSet`
 * `OTUSet` -> `Study`

 * `Tree` -> `TreeSet`
 * `TreeSet` -> `Study`
