  # Download the demo server from http://code.google.com/p/penn-ppod/downloads/detail?name=ppod-demo-server-0.2-dist.zip&can=2&q=#makechanges
  # `unzip ppod-demo-server-X.X.X-dist.zip`. This will create a directory `ppod-demo-server-X.X.X`
  # `cd` into ppod-demo-server-X.X.X
  # run `start-ppod-demo-server &`. You'll get a bunch of logging to standard out. To change that you can alter `config/log4j.properties` or redirect into a file.
