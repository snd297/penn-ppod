#summary How to run the pPOD Demo Server

= Running the pPOD Demo Server =

  * You'll need to get the zipped pPOD Mesquite package `pPODMesquitePackage-X.X.X.zip` from one of us.
  * Unzip it (it will expand into `pPODMesquitePackage-X.X.X`) and put the expanded directory where you want. We'll assume you put it into `${MESQUITE_HOME}/Mesquite_Folder`.
  * Add the appropriate entry in your `classpaths.xml` file, if you're using `${MESQUITE_HOME}/Mesquite_Folder` that would be
  {{{
    <classpath>./pPODMesquitePackage-X.X.X/Mesquite_Folder</classpath>
  }}}
  * Download the demo server from [http://code.google.com/p/penn-ppod/downloads/detail?name=ppod-demo-server-0.2-dist.zip ppod-demo-server-0.2-dist.zip]
  * Do `unzip ppod-demo-server-X.X.X-dist.zip` - this will create a directory `ppod-demo-server-X.X.X`
  * `cd` into `ppod-demo-server-X.X.X`
  * run 
  {{{
    ./start-ppod-demo-server &
  }}}
  You'll get a bunch of logging to standard out. To change that you can alter `config/log4j.properties` or redirect into a file.

  By default, the server listens on port 8080 for requests and on port 8081 for a shutdown command. To change this you can do 
  {{{
  ./start-ppod-demo-server some-other-port &
  }}}
  Then it will listen for shutdowns on `some-other-port + 1`.

  To stop the server run 
  {{{
    ./stop-ppod-server
  }}}
  or 
  {{{
    ./stop-ppod-server some-other-port + 1
  }}}
  if you ran on a port different than the default. Stopping may take a few seconds after the stop program returns.

You should now have a pPOD server running. It is prepopulated with TreeBASE data we can query on. See here for how to do that.
