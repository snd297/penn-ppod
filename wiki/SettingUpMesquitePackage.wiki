How to set up the pPOD Mesquite package under Eclipse to talk to a pPOD server.

  # Check out from the branch you're interested in. Trunk is at https://dbappserv.cis.upenn.edu/svnroot/develop/pPOD/mesquite/trunk/. You'll need to get a dbgroup Subversion account to access that repository. We'll assume that you call your project _pPODMesquitePackage_.
  # Assuming you already have Mesquite installed, add these entries to your _classpath.xml_ file: 
{{{
	<classpath>../../pPODMesquitePackage/Mesquite_Folder/</classpath>
}}}

Assuming you called your project pPODMesquitePackage.
