How to set up the pPOD Mesquite package under Eclipse to talk to a pPOD server.

  # Check out from the branch you're interested in. Trunk is at https://dbappserv.cis.upenn.edu/svnroot/develop/pPOD/mesquite/trunk/. You'll need to get a dbgroup Subversion account to access that repository. We'll assume that you call your project _pPODMesquitePackage_.

  I have this project checked in with the Eclipse config files, so you should just be able to do _Checkout..._ followed by _Check out as a project in the workspace_ and end up with a working Eclipse project.
  # Assuming you already have Mesquite installed, add this entry to Mesquite's _classpath.xml_ file: 
{{{
        <classpath>../../pPODMesquitePackage/Mesquite_Folder/</classpath>
}}}
  # Now we need to tell the pPOD Mesquite package about the pPOD server. You'll need to put a file _ppod.properties_ onto your classpath. There is an empty file _pPODMesquitePackage/Extras/ppod.properties_ that you can copy and modify. Take care not to check in your _ppod.properties_ as this will put your password into a more-or-less public place. In order to avoid this problem I made a directory _pPODMesquitePackage/Extras/config_ which I created an svn:ignore property for. Then I put _ppod.properties_ in there and add _config_ to my build path. (It only needs to be on the runtime classpath, but putting it onto the build path seems like the easiest way to make that happen if you have multiple run configurations.) This may have the added benefit of making for easier sharing of Eclipse configurations without causing conflicts as configurations ure updated into others' projects. 
  # Downloading from the pPOD Server: 

  _File>Open Other>Download from pPOD Database_ will query pPOD server for the projects it has stored and return a list for you to choose from. 

  (_File>Open Other>HQL Query against Database_ is experimental (aka "not guaranteed to work"), but [HQLSelectEquusSus here's] what that looks like when it's working.)

  Uploading to the pPOD server:

  Open up a Nexus file (currently only standard and DNA matrices are supported.) There is a _pPOD_ item in the project window which if clicked will reveal
    * *_Set pPOD Server_* this is not functional
    * *_Download changes_* this will download changes from the pPOD server to your project. This is not supposed to overwrite any local changes, however this is not a well-tested feature and is known not to work with trees.
    * *_Upload changes to Server w/ Molecular Matrices as pPOD Matrices_* this will upload your project storing the data as matrices in the pPOD server. 
    * *_Upload changes to Server w/ Molecular Matrices as pPOD Sequences_* this will upload your project storing the data as sequences in the pPOD server.

  Note that the last two items should appear identical to the user.
