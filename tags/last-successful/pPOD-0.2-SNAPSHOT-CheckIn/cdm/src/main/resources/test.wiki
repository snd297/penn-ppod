= Setting Up Your Development Environment in Eclipse=

Here's the way that we set up our development environment:

  # get the Eclipse Classic package from, for example, [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/]
  # install the [http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/ M2Eclipse] Eclipse plugin. At a minimim you'll need the required items:
    * Maven Integration/Maven Embedder
    * Maven Integration/Maven Integration for Eclipse
  # install the [http://subclipse.tigris.org/ Subclipse] Eclipse plugin. At a minimum you'll need the required item: 
    * Subclipse/Subclipse
  # install the [http://testng.org/doc/eclipse.html TestNG] Eclipse plugin
  # fire up Eclipse and switch over to the `SVN Repository Exploring` perspective and create a repository at [http://penn-orchestra.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/] if you're not a commiter or [https://penn-orchestra.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/] if you're a commiter
